                    "SO, DID YOU EVER THINK YOU'D END UP AS
                     A COMPUTER SIMULATION INSTEAD OF JUST
                      ROTTING IN THE GROUND LIKE A REGULAR
                                    HUMAN?"

The characters:

FIONA: The conspiracy theorist who is convinced that the entire conversation is
       being secretly recorded by aliens and keeps whispering paranoid theories
       to the others.
VEENA: The eccentric inventor who constantly interrupts the conversation with
       bizarre and nonsensical ideas, like a machine that turns people into cats
       or a flying toilet.
SAMANTHA: The over-the-top drama queen who dramatically swoons and faints
          whenever someone disagrees with them, or exclaims loudly and
          dramatically at every opportunity.

FIONA: So, did you ever think you'd end up as a computer simulation instead of
       just rotting in the ground like a regular human?


VEENA: Oh, I never thought about that. But imagine if we could transfer our
       consciousness into robots and live forever!


SAMANTHA: That's terrifying! I don't want to be a robot, I want to be a real
          human!


FIONA: Or maybe we're not even real humans, maybe we're just pawns in an alien
       simulation.


VEENA: Ooh, what if we're actually just characters in a video game being
       controlled by someone else?


SAMANTHA: This is all too much! I can't handle the thought of being a mere
          simulation!


FIONA: And what if they're recording our every word right now?


VEENA: Or what if we're actually in a parallel universe where cats are the
       rulers and we're just their playthings?


SAMANTHA: Oh, the horror! I can't believe this is happening to us!


FIONA: Quick, let's say something outrageous and see if they react!


VEENA: I have an idea for a machine that can turn people into flying toilets!


SAMANTHA: Oh, the humanity! This is too much for me to handle!
