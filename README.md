                        THAT WE'RE TECHNICALLY NOT ALIVE
                                   ANYMORE?"

The characters:

KAREN: A conspiracy theorist who is convinced that aliens walk among us and
       loves to share her outlandish theories.
DANIEL: A self-proclaimed psychic who constantly predicts absurd and unlikely
        events with complete confidence.

KAREN: So, do we still have to pay taxes now that we're technically not alive
       anymore?


DANIEL: Of course not, Karen. We're dead. Taxes are for the living.


KAREN: But what if the government is in on it? What if they know we're not
       really dead and they're still trying to take our money?


DANIEL: Oh, please. That's just your alien paranoia talking.


KAREN: Hey, I've seen some things, Daniel. I know the truth.


DANIEL: And I've predicted some pretty crazy things, but even I don't believe in
        your alien theories.


KAREN: Well, I guess we'll just have to wait and see if we get a tax refund from
       the afterlife then.


DANIEL: Or maybe we'll end up paying taxes in hell. You never know.


KAREN: Don't even joke about that, Daniel. I'm convinced the government has a
       deal with the devil too.
